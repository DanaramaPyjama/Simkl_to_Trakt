# Simkl_to_Trakt
A simple Python script that syncs Simkl watched status to trakt.

This script expects to be run on a scheduled event (Cron/Task scheduler), Every 15 minutes is great, but since it only checks for 12 hours of watch history, I would not recommend scheduling anything more than every 12, or change the value of how many hours history it checks for.

Some notes and caveats:

1. Authorisation tokens are stored in JSONs
2. They are NOT encrypted (plain text)
3. Tokens are generated by the script for both Simkl and Trakt, via APIs
4. If you delete a token.json, the script WILL replace it
5. Trakt had announced the fact that they were changing to 24 hour token refresh
6. ...But had NOT implemented it, therefore token refresh has been taken account of but is untested.

I do not use this script, nor do I offer any support for it. Please feel free to take it and do what you will with it.  Credits are always appreciated if you share it or publicise it.  This script should not make up part of any paid product.  No money can be changed hands for the use of this script.
